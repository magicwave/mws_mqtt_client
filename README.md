# mws\_mqtt\_client

An exploratory project for experimenting with the [Flutter](https://flutter.io) development platform, [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) messaging, and the [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) programming language.  

The initial codebase is the Flutter example app, extracted from the Dart [mqtt_client](https://github.com/shamblett/mqtt_client) package by Steve Hamblett.
